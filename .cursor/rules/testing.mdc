To get failing tests run [get_failing_tests.sh](mdc:tool/get_failing_tests.sh)
It includes the name and file of the failing tests in order to quickly determine which tests are failing.
`./tools/get_failing_tests.sh`

Tests where performance fails, consider if the sudden drop in performance is expected and adjust the test, otherwise diagnose the root cause of the test.

If you have broken an unexpected feature you weren't working on, see if you can adjust your work to fix the regression.
