## 📋 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### 🎯 **PRIORITY ORDER** (Sequential Dependencies)
1. **DR001, DR003, DR002A** *(Foundation - can develop in parallel)*
2. **DR002B** *(depends on DR002A)*
3. **DR002C** *(depends on DR002A & DR002B)*
4. **DR004, DR006, DR005A** *(Service layer - can develop in parallel after models)*
5. **DR005B** *(depends on DR005A)*
6. **DR007A** *(depends on DR003, DR006)*
7. **DR007B** *(depends on DR007A)*
8. **DR008, DR009, DR010, DR011** *(Specialized components - parallel after foundation)*

### ⚡ **PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES**
- **Phase 1**: DR001 + DR003 + DR002A simultaneously
- **Phase 2**: DR004 + DR006 + DR005A simultaneously
- **Phase 4**: DR008 + DR009 + DR010 + DR011 simultaneously

### 🎮 **ESTIMATED TOTAL EFFORT**
**Original**: 16-20 hours → **Granular**: 28-34 hours *(includes improved testing and integration)*
