# DR007A - Three-Panel Layout Foundation Implementation

## 🎯 TICKET OBJECTIVE
Create the foundational three-panel layout structure for DiscordHomeScreen with basic component integration and layout coordination.

## 📋 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### ✅ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- [ ] Three-panel structure: Left sidebar + Center panel + Right sidebar
- [ ] Basic component integration with placeholder or mock components
- [ ] Panel width management with fixed and flexible sizing
- [ ] Layout coordination with LayoutService integration
- [ ] Theme integration for Discord-style appearance
- [ ] StatefulWidget screen orchestration with proper lifecycle

### ✅ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
- [ ] Panel layout: Left (250px fixed), Center (flexible), Right (300px fixed)
- [ ] Layout widgets: Row with Expanded and fixed-width Containers
- [ ] Component integration: Placeholder components for each panel
- [ ] State management: ListenableBuilder for reactive layout updates
- [ ] Theme integration: Discord-style colors and styling
- [ ] Lifecycle management: Proper StatefulWidget initialization

### ✅ ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE
- [ ] StatefulWidget for screen orchestration (mandatory for screens)
- [ ] Zero functional widget builders (extract to helper methods if needed)
- [ ] ListenableBuilder for reactive theme and layout state updates
- [ ] Component composition pattern for panel content
- [ ] Object-oriented navigation and state coordination
- [ ] Single source of truth via LayoutService integration

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 📂 FILE LOCATIONS
- `lib/screens/discord_home_screen.dart` - Main screen implementation
- `test/screens/discord_home_screen_test.dart` - Screen layout tests

### 🎯 KEY CLASSES
```dart
class DiscordHomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DiscordHomeScreenState createState() => _DiscordHomeScreenState();
}

class _DiscordHomeScreenState extends State<DiscordHomeScreen> {
  // Panel dimensions
  static const double leftSidebarWidth = 250.0;
  static const double rightSidebarWidth = 300.0;
  static const double minCenterPanelWidth = 400.0;
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: ListenableBuilder(
        listenable: services.layoutService,
        builder: (context, child) {
          return Row(
            children: [
              // Left Sidebar Panel
              _buildLeftSidebarPanel(),
              
              // Center Chat Panel  
              _buildCenterChatPanel(),
              
              // Right MCP Sidebar Panel
              _buildRightSidebarPanel(),
            ],
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
  
  Widget _buildLeftSidebarPanel();
  Widget _buildCenterChatPanel();
  Widget _buildRightSidebarPanel();
}
```

### 🔗 INTEGRATION POINTS
- **LayoutService**: Theme data and layout preferences
- **Panel Components**: Placeholder integration for child components
- **MaterialApp**: Theme integration for Discord styling
- **Services**: Basic services integration setup

## 🧪 TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### 📋 TEST CASES
- [ ] Layout structure: Verify three-panel Row layout
- [ ] Panel dimensions: Correct width allocation for each panel
- [ ] Theme integration: Proper theme application and updates
- [ ] Component integration: Placeholder components render correctly
- [ ] LayoutService integration: Reactive updates on layout changes
- [ ] Screen lifecycle: Proper StatefulWidget initialization
- [ ] Widget tree: Correct widget hierarchy and structure
- [ ] Responsive calculation: Minimum center panel width enforcement

### 🎯 PERFORMANCE TESTS
- [ ] Layout rendering: < 100ms for initial screen load
- [ ] Theme switching: < 50ms for complete layout re-render
- [ ] Widget rebuild: Efficient rebuilds on layout changes

## 🏆 DEFINITION OF DONE

### ✅ CODE QUALITY
- [ ] Zero linter errors/warnings
- [ ] All widget tests passing
- [ ] Basic layout functionality working
- [ ] Theme integration operational
- [ ] Component integration points established

### ✅ LAYOUT FOUNDATION
- [ ] Three-panel structure implemented and stable
- [ ] LayoutService integration working
- [ ] Theme system connected
- [ ] Component placeholder structure ready
- [ ] Ready for responsive behavior in DR007B

## 🔄 DEPENDENCIES
- **DR003**: Layout Preferences Model (REQUIRED)
- **DR006**: Layout Service (REQUIRED)

## 🎮 NEXT TICKETS
- DR007B: Responsive Behavior & Animations (depends on DR007A)
- DR008: Agent Sidebar Component (can develop in parallel)
- DR009: Chat Panel Component (can develop in parallel)
- DR010: MCP Sidebar Component (can develop in parallel)

## 📊 ESTIMATED EFFORT
**3-4 hours** - Basic layout structure and integration

## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATION
- **Risk**: Fixed panel widths could cause layout overflow on small screens
- **Mitigation**: Implement minimum width constraints and overflow handling
- **Risk**: Component integration could become complex
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple placeholder components and iterate

## 💡 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Focus on getting basic three-panel structure working first
- Use placeholder containers with distinct colors for easy visual verification
- Implement basic overflow handling for panel width constraints
- Prepare integration points for actual child components in future tickets
