# DR007B - Responsive Behavior & Collapse Animations Implementation

## 🎯 TICKET OBJECTIVE
Add responsive behavior, sidebar collapse animations, and mobile-friendly layout adaptations to DiscordHomeScreen with smooth transitions.

## 📋 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### ✅ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- [ ] Collapsible left and right sidebars with toggle controls
- [ ] Smooth animations for sidebar collapse/expand transitions
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior with automatic sidebar hiding
- [ ] Panel resize handles for user-controlled width adjustment
- [ ] Minimum width constraints to prevent layout breaking
- [ ] State persistence for collapsed sidebar preferences

### ✅ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
- [ ] Collapse animations: Smooth width transitions with AnimationController
- [ ] Mobile breakpoints: < 768px auto-hide sidebars, show only center
- [ ] Panel resizing: Draggable dividers for width adjustment
- [ ] Animation duration: 300ms standard for Discord-style transitions
- [ ] State persistence: Save collapsed states via LayoutService
- [ ] Overflow handling: Prevent layout overflow with proper constraints

### ✅ ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE
- [ ] Animation controllers: Proper lifecycle management with dispose()
- [ ] StatefulWidget integration: Animation state management
- [ ] ChangeNotifier updates: Sidebar state changes trigger UI updates
- [ ] Object-oriented callbacks: Proper event handling for toggle actions
- [ ] Single source of truth: LayoutService manages all sidebar states

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 📂 FILE LOCATIONS
- `lib/screens/discord_home_screen.dart` - Extended with responsive behavior
- `lib/components/layout/panel_divider.dart` - Resizable panel divider
- `test/screens/discord_home_screen_responsive_test.dart` - Responsive tests

### 🎯 KEY FEATURES ADDITIONS
```dart
class _DiscordHomeScreenState extends State<DiscordHomeScreen> 
    with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  // Animation controllers
  AnimationController _leftSidebarController;
  AnimationController _rightSidebarController;
  Animation<double> _leftSidebarAnimation;
  Animation<double> _rightSidebarAnimation;
  
  // Responsive breakpoints
  static const double mobileBreakpoint = 768.0;
  static const double tabletBreakpoint = 1024.0;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeAnimations();
  }
  
  void _initializeAnimations() {
    _leftSidebarController = AnimationController(
      duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
      vsync: this,
    );
    // ... animation setup
  }
  
  // Responsive behavior
  bool _shouldShowLeftSidebar(double screenWidth);
  bool _shouldShowRightSidebar(double screenWidth);
  void _toggleLeftSidebar();
  void _toggleRightSidebar();
  
  // Panel resizing
  void _onLeftPanelResize(double delta);
  void _onRightPanelResize(double delta);
  double _calculateCenterPanelWidth(double screenWidth);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LayoutBuilder(
      builder: (context, constraints) {
        return _buildResponsiveLayout(constraints);
      },
    );
  }
}
```

### 🔗 INTEGRATION POINTS
- **DR007A**: Extends basic three-panel layout foundation
- **LayoutService**: Sidebar state persistence and management
- **Panel Components**: Responsive visibility and sizing
- **Mobile Navigation**: Alternative navigation patterns for mobile

## 🧪 TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### 📋 TEST CASES
- [ ] Sidebar animations: Smooth collapse/expand transitions
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness: Proper sidebar hiding on small screens
- [ ] Panel resizing: Draggable divider functionality
- [ ] State persistence: Collapsed states survive app restarts
- [ ] Animation lifecycle: Proper controller initialization and disposal
- [ ] Overflow handling: Layout remains stable at all screen sizes
- [ ] Touch interactions: Mobile-friendly toggle controls
- [ ] Performance: Smooth 60fps animations

### 🎯 PERFORMANCE TESTS
- [ ] Animation performance: 60fps for all sidebar transitions
- [ ] Responsive calculations: < 16ms for layout updates
- [ ] Memory usage: No animation controller memory leaks

## 🏆 DEFINITION OF DONE

### ✅ CODE QUALITY
- [ ] Zero linter errors/warnings
- [ ] All responsive tests passing
- [ ] Animation performance verified
- [ ] Mobile testing completed
- [ ] State persistence working

### ✅ RESPONSIVE COMPLETENESS
- [ ] Smooth sidebar collapse animations
- [ ] Mobile-friendly responsive behavior
- [ ] Panel resizing functionality
- [ ] State persistence operational
- [ ] Complete Discord-style home screen ready

## 🔄 DEPENDENCIES
- **DR007A**: Three-Panel Layout Foundation (REQUIRED)

## 🎮 NEXT TICKETS
- DR008: Agent Sidebar Component (ready for integration)
- DR009: Chat Panel Component (ready for integration)
- DR010: MCP Sidebar Component (ready for integration)

## 📊 ESTIMATED EFFORT
**3 hours** - Responsive behavior and animations

## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATION
- **Risk**: Animation performance could degrade on slower devices
- **Mitigation**: Test on various devices and implement performance optimizations
- **Risk**: Complex responsive logic could introduce layout bugs
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing across breakpoints and orientations

## 💡 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Use Transform.translate for smooth animations instead of changing actual widths
- Implement proper animation curve (Curves.easeInOut) for Discord-style feel
- Consider using MediaQuery for responsive breakpoint detection
- Plan for keyboard shortcuts to toggle sidebars (Ctrl+B, Ctrl+Shift+B)
