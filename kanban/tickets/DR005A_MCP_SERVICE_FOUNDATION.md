# DR005A - MCP Content Service Foundation Implementation

## 🎯 TICKET OBJECTIVE
Create MCPContentService foundation with timer-based polling infrastructure, service architecture, and reactive content broadcasting for Discord-style real-time updates.

## 📋 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### ✅ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- [ ] Timer-based polling system with 5-second configurable intervals
- [ ] Agent-specific polling coordination (current active agent only)
- [ ] Service lifecycle management (start/stop/pause/resume)
- [ ] Real-time content broadcasting via ChangeNotifier
- [ ] Error handling framework for polling failures
- [ ] Memory-efficient polling with automatic cleanup

### ✅ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
- [ ] Timer management: Configurable polling intervals (default 5 seconds)
- [ ] Agent coordination: Track current active agent for targeted polling
- [ ] Service state: Running, paused, stopped states with proper transitions
- [ ] Broadcasting: ChangeNotifier for UI component updates
- [ ] Error handling: Exponential backoff, retry logic, error recovery
- [ ] Performance: Non-blocking background polling execution

### ✅ ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE
- [ ] Extends ChangeNotifier for reactive service updates
- [ ] Service layer: Business logic and polling coordination
- [ ] GetIt integration: Singleton service registration
- [ ] Object references: Manage MCPContentCollection instances directly
- [ ] Clean lifecycle: Proper timer disposal and resource cleanup

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 📂 FILE LOCATIONS
- `lib/services/mcp_content_service.dart` - Service foundation
- `test/services/mcp_content_service_test.dart` - Service tests

### 🎯 KEY CLASSES
```dart
enum MCPServiceState { stopped, running, paused }

class MCPContentService extends ChangeNotifier {
  Timer? _pollingTimer;
  MCPServiceState _state = MCPServiceState.stopped;
  String? _currentAgentId;
  final Duration _pollingInterval = Duration(seconds: 5);
  
  // Service lifecycle
  void startPolling(String agentId);
  void stopPolling();
  void pausePolling();
  void resumePolling();
  
  // State management
  MCPServiceState get state => _state;
  String? get currentAgentId => _currentAgentId;
  bool get isPolling => _state == MCPServiceState.running;
  
  // Agent coordination
  void switchAgent(String? agentId);
  void onAgentActivated(String agentId);
  void onAgentDeactivated();
  
  // Polling infrastructure
  Future<void> _executePollingCycle();
  void _handlePollingError(Exception error);
  void _scheduleNextPoll();
  bool _shouldPoll();
}
```

### 🔗 INTEGRATION POINTS
- **Agent Selection**: React to active agent changes from layout service
- **MCPContentCollection**: Target for content updates (prepared for DR005B)
- **GetIt Services**: Integration with services.dart registration
- **Error Handling**: Foundation for MCP server communication errors

## 🧪 TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### 📋 TEST CASES
- [ ] Service lifecycle: start, stop, pause, resume operations
- [ ] Timer management: Polling interval configuration and execution
- [ ] Agent coordination: Agent switching and polling target updates
- [ ] State transitions: Valid service state changes
- [ ] Error handling: Polling failure recovery and backoff
- [ ] Memory management: Timer cleanup and resource disposal
- [ ] Service integration: GetIt registration and dependency injection
- [ ] ChangeNotifier: Broadcasting verification on state changes

### 🎯 PERFORMANCE TESTS
- [ ] Polling overhead: < 10ms per polling cycle setup
- [ ] Timer accuracy: Polling intervals within ±100ms tolerance
- [ ] Memory efficiency: No timer or service memory leaks
- [ ] State transitions: < 5ms for service state changes

## 🏆 DEFINITION OF DONE

### ✅ CODE QUALITY
- [ ] Zero linter errors/warnings
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Test coverage > 90%
- [ ] Service lifecycle documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented

### ✅ FOUNDATION READY
- [ ] Timer-based polling infrastructure operational
- [ ] Agent coordination working correctly
- [ ] Service state management complete
- [ ] Error handling framework established
- [ ] Integration points ready for DR005B

## 🔄 DEPENDENCIES
- **DR002C**: Complete MCP content model series (REQUIRED)

## 🎮 NEXT TICKETS
- DR005B: MCP Server Integration & Content Sync (depends on DR005A)

## 📊 ESTIMATED EFFORT
**2-3 hours** - Service foundation and polling infrastructure

## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATION
- **Risk**: Timer-based polling could consume excessive resources
- **Mitigation**: Implement intelligent polling with pause/resume capabilities
- **Risk**: Service state management could become complex
- **Mitigation**: Simple state machine with clear transition rules

## 💡 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Design polling intervals to be configurable for different deployment scenarios
- Implement proper service disposal patterns for app lifecycle management
- Consider implementing adaptive polling intervals based on content change frequency
- Plan for future transition to real-time MCP server event streaming
